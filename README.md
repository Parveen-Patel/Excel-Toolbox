# 🔍 Excel Hack: VLOOKUP vs INDEX-MATCH

Two of the most popular lookup functions in Excel are **VLOOKUP** and **INDEX-MATCH**.  
Both help you search for values in a table, but they work differently.

---

## ⚖️ Differences

| Feature              | VLOOKUP                          | INDEX-MATCH                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Lookup Direction     | Only left-to-right               | Works both left-to-right & right-to-left |
| Flexibility          | Fixed column index number        | Dynamic, based on ranges             |
| Performance          | Slower on large datasets         | Faster and more efficient            |
| Maintenance          | Breaks if columns are inserted   | More robust, adapts to changes       |

## ✅ Pros & ❌ Cons

### VLOOKUP

### INDEX-MATCH

- ✅ Robust against column changes  
- ❌ Slightly harder to learn  
- ❌ Requires combining two functions
