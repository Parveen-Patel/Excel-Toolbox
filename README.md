# 🔍 Excel Hack: VLOOKUP vs INDEX-MATCH

Two of the most popular lookup functions in Excel are **VLOOKUP** and **INDEX-MATCH**.  
Both help you search for values in a table, but they work differently.

---

## ⚖️ Differences

| Feature              | VLOOKUP                          | INDEX-MATCH                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Lookup Direction     | Only left-to-right               | Works both left-to-right & right-to-left |
| Flexibility          | Fixed column index number        | Dynamic, based on ranges             |
| Performance          | Slower on large datasets         | Faster and more efficient            |
| Maintenance          | Breaks if columns are inserted   | More robust, adapts to changes       |

---

## ✅ Pros & ❌ Cons

### VLOOKUP
- ✅ Easy to learn and use  
- ✅ Great for quick lookups  
- ❌ Can’t look left  
- ❌ Breaks if columns are moved  

### INDEX-MATCH
- ✅ More flexible (can look left or right)  
- ✅ Handles large datasets better  
- ✅ Robust against column changes  
- ❌ Slightly harder to learn  
- ❌ Requires combining two functions  

---

## 🎯 When to Use
- Use **VLOOKUP** for simple, quick lookups in small tables.  
- Use **INDEX-MATCH** for complex, large, or frequently changing datasets.

# 🍿 Excel Hack: Using FILTER() (Example: for Inventory Status)

The `FILTER()` function allows you to extract specific rows from a dataset based on conditions.  
This is perfect for managing inventory, such as separating **in-stock** and **out-of-stock** items.

---

## 📝 Example Setup

| Snack Name | Quantity |
|------------|----------|
| Chips      | 10       |
| Cookies    | 0        |
| Soda       | 5        |
| Candy      | 0        |
| Nuts       | 12       |

---

## ✅ In-Stock Items

Formula: =FILTER(A2:A6, B2:B6>0, "No items in stock")

Explanation:
- `A2:A6` → Array of snack names  
- `B2:B6>0` → Include only rows where quantity is greater than 0  
- `"No items in stock"` → Message if no results are found  

Result:
Chips
Soda
Nuts

---

## ❌ Out-of-Stock Items

Formula: =FILTER(A2:A6, B2:B6=0, "All items available")


Explanation:
- `A2:A6` → Array of snack names  
- `B2:B6=0` → Include only rows where quantity equals 0  
- `"All items available"` → Message if no results are found  

Result:
Cookies
Candy

---

## 🎯 Why It’s Useful
- Quickly separates **in-stock** vs **out-of-stock** items.  
- Eliminates manual filtering or sorting.  
- Dynamic: updates automatically when quantities change.  

---

# ✂️ Excel Hack: Split Text into Columns with TEXTSPLIT()

The `TEXTSPLIT()` function allows you to break apart text into multiple cells based on a delimiter.  

---

## 📝 Example Setup

Suppose you have the following text in cell `A2`: John,25,Male,New York

---

## ✅ Formula
=TEXTSPLIT(A2, ",")
Explanation:

|------|-----|--------|----------|
| John | 25  | Male   | New York |

---

## 🎯 Why It’s Useful
- Quickly separates combined text into structured columns.  
- Eliminates the need for manual **Text to Columns** wizard.  
- Works dynamically: if the source text changes, the split results update automatically.

---

## ⚡ Pro Tips
- You can split by other delimiters too:
  - Space: `=TEXTSPLIT(A2, " ")`
  - Semicolon: `=TEXTSPLIT(A2, ";")`
- Combine with `FILTER()` or `SORT()` for advanced data manipulation.  
- Use optional arguments e.g =TEXTSPLIT(A2,,",") : Splits text vertically into rows instead of horizontally into columns.

# 👥 Excel Hack: Track Attendance with Checkboxes

Instead of manually typing "Present" or "Absent," you can use **checkboxes** to mark attendance and calculate presence percentage with formulas.

---

## 📝 Steps

1. **Create Employee List**  
   - In column A, list employee names (e.g., Alice, Bob, Charlie).

2. **Insert Checkboxes for Attendance**  
   - Select the range next to employee names (column B).  
   - Go to **Insert → Controls → Checkbox**.  
   - Place a checkbox in each cell of column B.  
   - Check the box ✅ if the employee is present, leave unchecked if absent.

3. **Count Attendance**  
   - Use `COUNTIF` to count checked boxes:  
     ```
     =COUNTIF(B2:B20, TRUE)
     ```
     → Counts how many employees are marked present.

5. **Calculate Presence Percentage**  
   - Divide present count by total employees:  
     ```
     =COUNTIF(B2:B20, TRUE) / COUNTA(A2:A20)
     ```
     → Returns the percentage of employees present.

---

## 🎯 Why It’s Useful
- Eliminates manual typing of "Present/Absent."  
- Provides a **visual and interactive** way to track attendance.  
- Automatically calculates attendance percentage for quick reporting.

---
